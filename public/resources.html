            <h2>Stress</h2>
            <p>Stress is your body's reaction to pressure or threats. In small doses it can help you perform under
                pressure, but chronic stress may lead to physical symptoms such as headaches, sleep problems, or
                irritability. To manage stress try regular exercise, time management techniques, and relaxation
                practices like deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation.</p>

        <section id="anxiety">
            <h2>Anxiety</h2>
            <p>Anxiety is a feeling of worry or fear that can be mild or overwhelming. Persistent anxiety may be
                associated with panic attacks, restlessness, or difficulty concentrating. Grounding techniques,
                limiting caffeine, and seeking support are helpful first steps. If anxiety interferes with daily
                life, consider talking to a professional.</p>

            <h2>Depression</h2>
            <p>Depression involves feelings of sadness, loss, or hopelessness that last for weeks or longer.
                It can affect your sleep, appetite, and energy levels. Reach out to loved ones, establish a routine,
                and engage in activities you used to enjoy. Professional help such as therapy and medication are
                effective treatments.</p>

        <section id="self-care">
            <h2>Self‑Care</h2>

                practices include getting enough sleep, eating well, staying active, setting boundaries, and doing
                things that bring you joy. Self‑care isn't selfish — it's necessary.</p>
